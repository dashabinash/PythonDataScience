#Q:- Split the following String into a List
#      s='Hi there Sam!'
#      Note- use .format() to print the following String



#Q:- Given this nest dictionary. Grab the word "hello". Be prepared, this will be annoying/tricky
#    d={'k1':[1,2,3,{'tricky':['oh','man','inception',{'target':[1,2,3,'hello']}]}]}
 


#Q:- What is the main difference between a tuple and a list?


#Q:- Create a function that grabs the eamil website domain from a String in the form:
#     user@domain.com
#     So for example, passing "user@domain.com" would return: domain.com
def getDomain(email="NONE"):
    """

#Q:- Create a basic function that returns True if the word 'dog' is contained in the input string.
#    Don't worry about the edge cases like a punctuation being attached to the word dog, but do
#    account for capitalization



#Q:- Create a function that counts the number of times the word 'dog' occurs in a string.
#    Again ignore edge cases.




#Q:- Use lambda expressions and filter() function to filter out words from a list that don't start
#    with the letter 's'. For example
#       seq=['soup','dog','salad','cat','great']
#    should be filtered out to:
#        ['soup','salad']



#Q:- You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function one of 3 possible
#    results:"No ticket","Small ticket" or "Big ticket". If your speed is 60 or less, the result is "No ticket"
#    If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is "Small ticket". If speed is 81 or more, the result
#    is "Big ticket". Unless it is your birthday(encoded as a boolean value in the parameters of the function)--
#    on your birthday, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.
